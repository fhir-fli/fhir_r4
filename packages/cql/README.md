## Questions

- The middle example for [Duration](https://cql.hl7.org/09-b-cqlreference.html#duration) would seem to suggest that if one input is specified with more precision, then the Duration is given as a range. If this is the case, should the example not be [1, 11]?
- I don't understand the difference between [Difference](https://cql.hl7.org/09-b-cqlreference.html#difference) which "returns the number of boundaries crossed for the specified precision" and Duration, which "returns the number of whole calendar periods for the specified precision".
