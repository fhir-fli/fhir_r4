/// Operator to determine if the first interval overlaps and ends after the
/// second interval.
/// Returns true if End(i1) > End(i2) and Start(i1) <= End(i2).
/// If precision is specified and the point type is Date, DateTime, or Time,
/// comparisons used in the operation are performed at the specified precision.
/// If either argument is null, the result is null.
/// Signature:
///
/// overlaps _precision_ (left Interval<T>, right Interval<T>) Boolean
/// overlaps before _precision_ (left Interval<T>, right Interval<T>) Boolean
/// overlaps after _precision_ (left Interval<T>, right Interval<T>) Boolean
/// Description:
///
/// The overlaps operator returns true if the first interval overlaps the
/// second. More precisely, if the starting or ending point of either interval
/// is in the other, or if the ending point of the first interval is greater
/// than or equal to the starting point of the second interval, and the starting
/// point of the first interval is less than or equal to the ending point of the
/// second interval.
///
/// The operator overlaps before returns true if the first interval overlaps the
/// second and starts before it, while the overlaps after operator returns true
/// if the first interval overlaps the second and ends after it.
///
/// This operator uses the semantics described in the Start and End operators to
/// determine interval boundaries.
///
/// If precision is specified and the point type is a Date, DateTime, or Time
/// type, comparisons used in the operation are performed at the specified
/// precision.
///
/// If either argument is null, the result is null.
///
/// The following examples illustrate the behavior of the overlaps, overlaps
/// before, and overlaps after operators:
///
/// define "OverlapsIsTrue": Interval[0, 4] overlaps Interval[1, 4]
/// define "OverlapsBeforeIsTrue": Interval[0, 4] overlaps before Interval[1, 4]
/// define "OverlapsAfterIsFalse": Interval[0, 4] overlaps after Interval[1, 4]
/// define "OverlapsIsNull": Interval[6, 10] overlaps (null as Interval<Integer>)
